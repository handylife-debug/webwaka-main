# WebWaka E-Commerce Platform - Biological Hierarchical System

## Overview
The WebWaka E-Commerce Platform is a multi-vendor e-commerce solution built with a biological hierarchical system architecture, emphasizing cellular independence and 100% component reusability. The platform aims to provide a robust, secure, and scalable system for online commerce, including specialized features for the Nigerian market. Key capabilities include multi-vendor management, order splitting and fulfillment, B2B access control, and comprehensive security.

## User Preferences
- **Cellular Reusability**: Hardcoded requirement - reuse existing cells and codebase without duplicating functionality
- **Documentation**: Each completed subtask must be fully documented and pushed to GitHub immediately
- **Architecture**: Follow established cellular architecture pattern with client.tsx/server.ts structure
- **Security**: Implement proper encryption, RBAC authorization, and tenant scoping
- **Integration**: Push code to GitHub after each major completion using established connection

## System Architecture

### Core Design Principles
The platform adheres to a "biological hierarchical system" architecture, where each "cell" is a fundamental, 100% reusable functional unit. This includes strict cellular independence, eliminating direct cross-cell imports and relying solely on Cell Bus communication.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **UI Components**: Radix UI, Lucide React icons
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Authentication**: Cookie-based sessions with JWT-like tokens
- **Security**: Comprehensive security hardening including JWT-based authentication, tenant isolation, SQL injection prevention, CSRF protection, and RBAC authorization.

### Key Features & Implementations
- **Cellular Structure**: Organized into `cells/` directory, with subdirectories for `ecommerce/` containing independent cells like `VendorOnboardingManagement`, `MultiStoreMarketplace`, `OrderSplittingFulfillment`, and `B2BAccessControl`.
- **UI/UX**: Utilizes Radix UI and Tailwind CSS for a consistent and modern design. Vendor and partner dashboards extend existing architectures for reusability.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Designed with tenant-scoped data and proper isolation.
- **E-commerce Capabilities**:
    - **Vendor Onboarding**: System for vendor applications, business details, tax info, and admin approval workflows.
    - **Multi-Store Marketplace**: Separate vendor dashboards, individual store pages with custom branding, product mapping, and store management.
    - **Order Splitting & Fulfillment**: Automated multi-vendor order splitting, fulfillment routing, and unified customer tracking.
    - **B2B Access Control**: Management for wholesale customers, including guest price hiding, category restrictions, and group management.
- **Regional Features**: Includes specific features for the Nigerian market such as Naira currency defaults, CAC registration, tax ID, and 7.5% VAT compliance.

## Phase 3: Cellular Independence Achievements
