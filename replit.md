# Overview

This project is a Next.js 15 multi-tenant SaaS application that enables users to create custom, emoji-branded subdomains. It provides a main domain for subdomain registration and an administrative interface for tenant management. Each subdomain operates as an independent tenant space with its own branding and content. The platform utilizes an advanced "WebWaka Biological Cell System" for modularity and scalability, aiming to automate complex business workflows across various sectors, including POS, E-commerce, and CRM.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**GitHub Push Methodology**: When user requests to push code to GitHub, ALWAYS use the creative GitHub API solution instead of standard Git operations. The system is already connected with PAT token, so use the GitHub REST API with Octokit integration to upload files directly. User should never have to handle technical Git operations manually.

**Creative GitHub API Push Process**:
1. Use the GitHub integration: `connection:conn_github_01K55BXKEF6E9E6EK2C4344X42`
2. Create upload script using Octokit with `@octokit/rest` package
3. Upload files via GitHub API to repository: `handylife-debug/webwaka-main`
4. Handle both new file creation and existing file updates (with SHA)
5. Use professional commit messages with detailed feature descriptions
6. Clean up temporary scripts after successful upload
7. This approach bypasses Git lock issues and provides reliable code deployment

**Autonomous Workflow**: After completing any task, ALWAYS automatically: (1) **Reuse Audit** - verify 100% code reuse compliance per ADR-0001, (2) Document changes in replit.md, (3) Push to GitHub using creative API solution, (4) Move immediately to next pending task without asking. Keep building continuously until all WebWaka Biological Cells are complete.

**🔐 REUSE-FIRST MANDATE (ADR-0001)**: All development MUST follow the Reuse-First principle. Before creating ANY new code: (1) Search existing cells for similar functionality, (2) Reuse existing modules instead of creating duplicates, (3) Extend existing cells rather than creating parallel implementations, (4) Declare all dependencies in cell.json, (5) Zero tolerance for >15 lines code duplication. This principle is permanently hardcoded and enforced via automated tooling.

# System Architecture
