## Technical Implementation

### Authentication & Security

#### Role-Based Access Control

if (!hasRequiredRole(user, 'Partner')) {
  redirect('/');
}
```

#### Data Isolation
- Partner-specific data filtering at the database level
- Secure partner identification via authenticated user sessions
- Multi-tenant architecture preventing cross-partner data access

### Data Integration

#### Real-Time Data
```typescript
// Dashboard metrics calculation
const dashboardMetrics = await getPartnerDashboardMetrics(partnerId);
// Returns: total_earnings, pending_payouts, direct_referrals, payable_balance
```

#### Commission Data
```typescript
// Comprehensive commission reporting
const reportData = await getPartnerCommissionReport(partnerId, {
  limit: 50,
  status: 'pending',
  date_from: '2024-01-01',
  date_to: '2024-12-31'
});
```

#### Payout Management
```typescript
// Payout request creation
const payoutRequest = await createPayoutRequest({
  partner_id: partnerId,
  requested_amount: 500.00,
  payment_method: 'bank_transfer'
});
```

### Performance Optimizations

#### Caching Strategy
- Partner metrics caching for faster dashboard loads
- Commission data pagination for large datasets
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing

#### Loading Optimization
